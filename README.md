# DMCA Link Grabber
This tool is meant for cammers to generate a list of links for DMCA purposes from the sites that have automated recording and publishing of shows. 

## Requirements
You need to enable execution of unsigned PowerShell scripts on your system to run this. This will mean that any downloaded PowerShell script will be able to run, and this has the same implication as being able to run any random `.exe` file you come across. If you are not comfortable with this, that's perfectly fine - feel free to ask more questions about it or simply do not use it.

### Steps
 1. Open a PowerShell prompt as Admin: Press `Win` + `X` -> select `Windows PowerShell (Admin)` (`Terminal (Admin)` on Windows 11)
 2. Paste in `Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted`
 3. Read the prompt, type `Y` and press `Enter` if you understand.
